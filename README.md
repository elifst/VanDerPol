Runge Kutta 4 Method Example
%This solution should orbit about the steady state solution. Because one
%expects there should be some balance between fox and rabbit number. If
%number of rabbits are greater than number of foxes there will be plenty of
%rabbits for the foxes and this will result in increase in the fox
%population. But as fox population increases rabbit population will
%decrease as a result. This means both x prime and y prime should equal to
%zero.(Steady-State Equilibrium Solution)
